"Output: Sample 1: The output is [1, 2], which does not match the expected output of [1, 2] (correct). Sample 2: The input [3, 2, 4] with target = 6 was not tested in the user's code; therefore, it cannot be validated. Sample 3: The input [3, 3] with target = 6 was also not tested in the user's code; hence it cannot be validated. Only Sample 1 output matched expectations.\nPassed 1/3 testcases\n AI driven score is: 3.3333333333333335/10 "
